# Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) with DeepSpeech

## Description

This project showcases the development of an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system using the DeepSpeech model. The ASR system is trained and tested with a custom dataset created specifically for this project. The objective is to leverage DeepSpeech's capabilities to accurately transcribe spoken language into text.

## Introduction

DeepSpeech is an open-source ASR engine developed by Mozilla, based on the Deep Speech research paper by Baidu. This project demonstrates the application of DeepSpeech in building a custom ASR system tailored to a specific dataset.

## Features

- **Custom Dataset:** Utilizes a self-created dataset for training and testing.
- **DeepSpeech Model:** Employs the DeepSpeech model for ASR tasks.
- **High Accuracy:** Achieves high accuracy in speech-to-text conversion.
- **Flexible Training:** Supports training with different configurations and hyperparameters.
- **Comprehensive Evaluation:** Provides detailed evaluation metrics and results.

## Dataset

The dataset for this project consists of recorded audio files and their corresponding transcriptions. The dataset is structured as follows:



### Creating the Dataset

1. **Recording Audio:**
   - Record audio files in WAV format.
   - Save the audio files in the `audio/` directory.

2. **Transcribing Audio:**
   - Create text files containing the transcriptions of the corresponding audio files.
   - Save the transcription files in the `transcripts/` directory with the same name as the audio files.

## Model Architecture

The DeepSpeech model architecture consists of several layers, including:

- **Input Layer:** Accepts the raw audio waveform.
- **Convolutional Layers:** Extract features from the audio signal.
- **Recurrent Layers:** Capture temporal dependencies in the audio sequence.
- **Fully Connected Layers:** Perform the final classification to generate transcriptions.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/deepspeech-asr.git
   cd deepspeech-asr


##Training the Model
The training script is configured to use the custom dataset. You can adjust hyperparameters and configurations in the train.py script to suit your needs.

##Evaluation
The evaluation script provides metrics such as Word Error Rate (WER) and Character Error Rate (CER) to assess the performance of the ASR system.

##Results
Detailed results of the ASR system's performance, including accuracy and error rates, will be documented here after training and evaluation.
